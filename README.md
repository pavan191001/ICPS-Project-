# ICPS-Project-

course name - introduction to cyber physical systems 
 
Project name - Toll Gate Management and Smart Light Systems

sub parts of project -
  1. Lane Suggestion 
  2. Vehicle Count Information
  3. Notification to check balance in the wallet 
  4. Smart Street Light System

this project helps us to save electricity since solar energy also useful 
street lights in highways are functioned using solar energy but it should not be wasted, so to avoid that we build a prototype of that project part 

to understand better we used a simulator(tinkercad)

components for hardware build of prototype

  1. IR sensors
  2. Servo Motors
  3. Arduino 
  4. LEDs
  5. 16*2 LCD display 
  6. bread board
